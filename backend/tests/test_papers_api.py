"""Tests for the Papers REST surface (Task 12, Plan C).

All tests use the ASGI test client pattern from test_chat_sse.py:
  - create_app() creates an isolated app instance
  - PAPERHUB_WORKSPACE env var points to tmp_path so each test gets its own DB
  - PaperPipeline.ingest is patched at the module level to avoid real network calls
